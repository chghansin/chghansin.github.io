Figure above is showing the block diagram of our PWM voltage regulator circuit. First, it starts with the input AC signal and it pass through full-wave rectifier with filter capacitors to smoothen the input signal. After that it is connected to buck converter with the MOSFET irf9z34 which is controlled by the Pulse Width Modulator LM3524. And it comes to the feedback voltage divider stage which can influence the output voltage from the circuit.
