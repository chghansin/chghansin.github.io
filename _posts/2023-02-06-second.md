Figure above is showing the block diagram of our PWM voltage regulator circuit. First, it starts with the input AC signal and it pass through full-wave rectifier with filter capacitors to smoothen the input signal. After that it is connected to buck converter with the MOSFET irf9z34 which is controlled by the Pulse Width Modulator LM3524. And it comes to the feedback voltage divider stage which can influence the output voltage from the circuit.

# Project Result
* When Rload = 1k Ohms, Vout=3.0505V, Ripple voltage 200mV
* When Rload = 220 Ohms, Vout=3.0402V, Ripple voltage 240mV
* When Rload = 33 Ohms, Vout=3.0173, Ripple voltage 360mV

According to the observation from applying different load resister, despite of changes in Rload, the designed circuit was able to generate regulated voltage around 3V. However, the ripple voltage increased while we changing to medium and heavy loads. The ripple voltage might be able to mitigate by changing the value of the capacitor or change in current from the inductor.
