title: "3D printing with the robot arm"
---

# Abstract
A robotic arm can be made out of 3D printers as well as used to perform 3D printing. It is now possible to use a robotic arm to print from different angles and objects with complex geometries.

# Mount Design
The developed system consist of a 3D extruder mounted onto an ABB robotic arm capable to print 3D object models.

# Circuit Schematics
The circuit consists of a microcontroller (Atmega2560), Extruder and hotbed, motor driver shields, 2 MOSFETs for temperature control and relay for communication with the robot arm's control box

# 3D CAD Model and Slicer to G-code
Solidworks CAD/CAM software is used for designing 3D object models. The 3D model also can be downloaded from the opensource.
The slicer, also called slicing software, is used in the 3D printing process for the conversion of 3D object models.

# Rapid code
In this project,, the robot arm model of IRB-1200 is used from the ABB which consist of 6 DOF, therefore, with the output from the g-code does not satisfy the 
transition since the controlling system of the robot requires the inverse kinematics to execute the movement of 6 servos 
located in the industrial robot. Therefore, by the help of ABB robot studio add-in, the tasks could be simplified and achieved.  
Now, successfully converted the G-code cartesian coordinates into RAPID commends. Where it includes parameters such as: x-y-z coordinates, robot feed rate, zone, TCP settings, and work-objects.

# Update to robot controller
The robot controller controls the movement of the industrial robot arm with the communication of the microcontroller.
