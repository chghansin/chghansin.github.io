# Human Entry and Exit Detection
* 2 Ultrasonic sensors and buzzer
* Integrated into a microprocessor Raspberry Pi

The hardware setup will be put on the top of the sensor holder so the 2 ultrasonic sensors with
buzzer can vertically work their detecting function.

**Hardware setup**

# QR code detection
* External camera
* OpenCV in python

On a successful scan, the LCD displays student number on the console, otherwise, displays the message to leave the room.
